Senior project implementation of an Electronic Control Module focused on the Fuel Management System of a small one cylinder EFI engine developed by EE & ECE students of The University of Texas at El Paso. 

It is an open source Electronic Control Unit focused on the Fuel Management System of a small 1 cylinder EFI engine (Honda GX35 Engine) based on the "Honda GX35 Engine Fuel Injection kit" sold by [ecotrons.com](https://www.ecotrons.com/small_engine_fuel_injection_kit/honda_gx35_engine_fuel_injection_kit/) and its sensors included in its kit.
